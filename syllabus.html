			Academic Integrity & CSU Honor Pledge: This course will adhere to the CSU Academic
	Integrity/Misconduct policy as found in the General Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. All the work
	that you do in this class should be your own work with originality and without sharing academic work
	unless a group assignment has been given. Examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited
	to) paraphrasing/quoting content without referencing the source, unauthorized sharing of exams,
	receiving unauthorized assistance or working as a group on a take-home exam, or lying to extend the due
	date. For more information on academic integrity, check out CSU’s Academic Honesty and Integrity.
	Academic integrity lies at the core of our common goal: to create an intellectually honest and rigorous
	community. Because academic integrity, and the personal and social integrity of which academic integrity
	is an integral part, it is so central to our mission as students, teachers, scholars, and citizens, I will ask that
	you affirm the CSU Honor Pledge as part of completing your work in this course.
	The use of online “homework helper” sites including, but not limited to,
	Chegg, NoteHall, Quizlet, and Koofers is not permitted in this course. Use of
	these types of resources will be considered receiving unauthorized assistance
	and, therefore, a violation of the student conduct code.
	Although I do not expect it to happen in this class, students engaged in academic misconduct will be
	penalized. Depending on the degree of misconduct, penalties range from failure on an individual
	assignment to failure of the course to expulsion from the University. Refer to the CIS Department’s
	Academic Integrity Policy (posted on Canvas under the “Syllabus” section) for more details. Questions
	related to course assignments and the academic integrity policy should be directed to the professor.
