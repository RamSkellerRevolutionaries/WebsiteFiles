            <h2>Disciplinary Actions</h2>
			<p>Academic Integrity & CSU Honor Pledge: This course will adhere to the CSU Academic
				Integrity/Misconduct policy as found in the General Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. All the work
				that you do in this class should be your own work with originality and without sharing academic work
				unless a group assignment has been given. Examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited
				to) paraphrasing/quoting content without referencing the source, unauthorized sharing of exams,
				receiving unauthorized assistance or working as a group on a take-home exam, or lying to extend the due
				date. For more information on academic integrity, check out CSU’s Academic Honesty and Integrity.
				Academic integrity lies at the core of our common goal: to create an intellectually honest and rigorous
				community. Because academic integrity, and the personal and social integrity of which academic integrity
				is an integral part, it is so central to our mission as students, teachers, scholars, and citizens, I will ask that
				you affirm the CSU Honor Pledge as part of completing your work in this course.
				The use of online “homework helper” sites including, but not limited to,
				Chegg, NoteHall, Quizlet, and Koofers is not permitted in this course. Use of
				these types of resources will be considered receiving unauthorized assistance
				and, therefore, a violation of the student conduct code.
				Although I do not expect it to happen in this class, students engaged in academic misconduct will be
				penalized. Depending on the degree of misconduct, penalties range from failure on an individual
				assignment to failure of the course to expulsion from the University. Refer to the CIS Department’s
				Academic Integrity Policy (posted on Canvas under the “Syllabus” section) for more details. Questions
				related to course assignments and the academic integrity policy should be directed to the professor.

            <h2>Rounding Grades</h2>
            <p>The cutoff points for determining the final grade are strictly enforced. I will calculate the final grades to 2
                significant digits and then add one rounding point to your grade. If, after your grade is calculated, your
                final points sum up to 88.99, I will then add the one rounding point to your score. Your grade (89.99)
                would be B+ for the course. If after your grade is calculated your final points sum up to 89.00, I will add
                one rounding point to your score. Your grade (90.00) would be A- for the course. (This is actually
                preferable to rounding since it gives you the opportunity for 1 point as opposed to the 0.5 points maximum
                that you would get if grades were rounded in a more traditional manner).
            </p>

            <h2>Course Materials & Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Canvas:</strong> It is your responsibility to monitor Canvas (http://info.canvas.colostate.edu/login.aspx) on a daily
                basis. I use Canvas heavily for posting due dates, assignments, grades, class notes, etc. Class slides will
                generally be posted one or two days before class. The purpose of class slides is to outline key points and
                set up examples that will be discussed in class (i.e., they are not a substitute for taking good notes!).
                Changes to the syllabus, the course schedule, lecture topics, etc., will be posted to Canvas as/if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Required Readings:</strong> There is no textbook for this course. A list of required readings or other materials
                (e.g., videos) will be posted on Canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Software Tools:</strong> Microsoft Visio to create Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and PowerPoint
                storyboarding tools for user interface design. This software is available in the Rockwell Hall computer labs
                (rooms 37-38) and via College of Business eLab Remote Desktop (browse to
                https://secure.colostate.edu). You are not required to use these specific tools for modeling and user
                interface design, but these are the ones that I will use in class.
