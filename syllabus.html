            <h2>Disciplinary Actions</h2>
			<p>Academic Integrity & CSU Honor Pledge: This course will adhere to the CSU Academic
				Integrity/Misconduct policy as found in the General Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. All the work
				that you do in this class should be your own work with originality and without sharing academic work
				unless a group assignment has been given. Examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited
				to) paraphrasing/quoting content without referencing the source, unauthorized sharing of exams,
				receiving unauthorized assistance or working as a group on a take-home exam, or lying to extend the due
				date. For more information on academic integrity, check out CSU’s Academic Honesty and Integrity.
				Academic integrity lies at the core of our common goal: to create an intellectually honest and rigorous
				community. Because academic integrity, and the personal and social integrity of which academic integrity
				is an integral part, it is so central to our mission as students, teachers, scholars, and citizens, I will ask that
				you affirm the CSU Honor Pledge as part of completing your work in this course.
				The use of online “homework helper” sites including, but not limited to,
				Chegg, NoteHall, Quizlet, and Koofers is not permitted in this course. Use of
				these types of resources will be considered receiving unauthorized assistance
				and, therefore, a violation of the student conduct code.
				Although I do not expect it to happen in this class, students engaged in academic misconduct will be
				penalized. Depending on the degree of misconduct, penalties range from failure on an individual
				assignment to failure of the course to expulsion from the University. Refer to the CIS Department’s
				Academic Integrity Policy (posted on Canvas under the “Syllabus” section) for more details. Questions
				related to course assignments and the academic integrity policy should be directed to the professor.

            <h2>Rounding Grades</h2>
            <p>The cutoff points for determining the final grade are strictly enforced. I will calculate the final grades to 2
                significant digits and then add one rounding point to your grade. If, after your grade is calculated, your
                final points sum up to 88.99, I will then add the one rounding point to your score. Your grade (89.99)
                would be B+ for the course. If after your grade is calculated your final points sum up to 89.00, I will add
                one rounding point to your score. Your grade (90.00) would be A- for the course. (This is actually
                preferable to rounding since it gives you the opportunity for 1 point as opposed to the 0.5 points maximum
                that you would get if grades were rounded in a more traditional manner).
            </p>
            <div class="striped-border"></div>
            <h2>Course Materials & Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Canvas:</strong> It is your responsibility to monitor Canvas (http://info.canvas.colostate.edu/login.aspx) on a daily
                basis. I use Canvas heavily for posting due dates, assignments, grades, class notes, etc. Class slides will
                generally be posted one or two days before class. The purpose of class slides is to outline key points and
                set up examples that will be discussed in class (i.e., they are not a substitute for taking good notes!).
                Changes to the syllabus, the course schedule, lecture topics, etc., will be posted to Canvas as/if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Required Readings:</strong> There is no textbook for this course. A list of required readings or other materials
                (e.g., videos) will be posted on Canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Software Tools:</strong> Microsoft Visio to create Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and PowerPoint
                storyboarding tools for user interface design. This software is available in the Rockwell Hall computer labs
                (rooms 37-38) and via College of Business eLab Remote Desktop (browse to
                https://secure.colostate.edu). You are not required to use these specific tools for modeling and user
                interface design, but these are the ones that I will use in class.

            <h2>COVID-19 Resources</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Important information for students: All students are expected and required to report any COVID-19
                symptoms to the university immediately, as well as exposures or positive tests from a non-CSU
                testing location.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>If you suspect you have symptoms, or if you know you have been exposed to a positive person or have
                tested positive for COVID, you are required to fill out the COVID Reporter
                (https://covid.colostate.edu/reporter/). If you know or believe you have been exposed, including living with
                someone known to be COVID positive, or are symptomatic, it is important for the health of yourself and
                others that you complete the online COVID Reporter. Do not ask your instructor to report for you. If you
                do not have internet access to fill out the online COVID-19 Reporter, please call (970) 491-4600. You may
                also report concerns in your academic or living spaces regarding COVID exposures through the COVID
                Reporter. You will not be penalized in any way for reporting. When you complete the COVID Reporter for
                any reason, the CSU Public Health office is notified. Once notified, that office will contact you and,
                depending upon each situation, will conduct contact tracing, initiate any necessary public health
                requirements and notify you if you need to take any steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the latest information about the University’s COVID resources and information, please visit the CSU
                COVID-19 site: https://covid.colostate.edu/.
            </p>
            <div class="striped-border"></div>
            <h2>Assessment Categories</h2>
            <p><strong>Exams: </strong>Exams are designed to test your individual mastery of the course material in a controlled setting.
                Exams consist of closed- and open-ended questions and problems. The final exam is comprehensive.
                Exam dates are listed in the class schedule and are not expected to change.
            </p>
            <p>If you miss an exam for a <u>valid and documented</u> reason, the points from the missed exam will be
                allocated to the final exam (i.e., I generally do not write make-up exams). In the case of a missed final
                exam, a special makeup exam might be given or other arrangements decided by the professor might be
                made <u>no later than one week after the exam</u>. Even with a valid and documented reason, failure to provide
                a <strong>timely</strong> notification may lead to a zero grade:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you must miss an exam for a <u>valid and documented</u> reason (e.g., jury duty, a university
                    sanctioned excuse), let me know at least 72 hours prior to the exam.</li>
                <li>In the case of a <u>documented</u> emergency causing a student to miss an exam, let me know as
                    soon as possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Permission to take a make-up exam will be given only for documented, extreme circumstances. Parking
                problems, alarm malfunctions, or vacation travel conflicts are not valid reasons. In fairness to all students,
                valid absences need to be documented. This means that, for example, if you are sick with the flu on exam
                day, you need to go to a doctor because you will need a note from him/her to justify your absence.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Exercises: </strong> Exercises are short, individual or group assignments that are completed during a class session
                or before class. For example, an exercise may ask you to summarize key points from a guest speaker
                presentation, or to work in a small group on a modeling problem. There will be about 6-10 exercises over
                the course of the semester. Because the purpose of some exercises is to encourage class attendance
                and provide quick feedback, <u>late submissions will not be accepted</u>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Other Assignments: </strong> There are other written assignments due throughout the semester (see the class
                schedule). These assignments encourage you to keep up with the assigned readings or practice skills
                that are not explicitly covered in the team project (described below). They also provide quick feedback on
                the material and prepare you for the exams. Assignment details will be posted on Canvas, generally a
                week before they are due. Submit your assignments on Canvas by the deadline. <u>A 10% penalty will be
                assessed for each calendar day that the submission is late</u>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Team Project: </strong> In practice, systems development is a team effort. In CIS360, you will work in a team on a
                real-world business case assigned by the professor. You will take on the role of consultants who have 
                been hired by a client to do the front-end work on a systems development project. This includes analyzing
                the business problem, identifying opportunities to address the problem with a new or improved
                information system, determining and specifying the requirements for the information system, creating a
                user interface mock-up for the new system, and presenting your mock-up to the class. <u>You will NOT build
                or implement the new system</u>.
            </p>
            <p>You may <u>self-select your team of 4-5 members</u>. If you want us to assign you to a team, submit the Team
                Membership Request form (on Canvas) by the date specified in the Course Schedule. The project will
                start in the 3rd week of class. Choose your team members carefully, as you will be working together for
                most of the semester.
            </p>
            <p>The project grade is based on two major client deliverables (i.e., a software requirements document and a
                user interface mock-up & demonstration) and two minor deliverables (i.e., a project charter and a
                progress report/meeting). The minor deliverables exist to discourage procrastination and encourage high
                quality major deliverables. See the class schedule and Canvas for due dates. <u>A 10% penalty will be
                assessed for each calendar day that a deliverable is late. There are no make-ups for missed
                demonstrations or progress report meetings</u>.
            </p>
            <p>At the end of the project, you will evaluate your team members' contributions to the project. <u>Individual
                project grades will be adjusted based on these peer evaluations</u>, so that your individual grade may be
                lower than, the same as, or higher than the overall group grade. The deliverables and the peer evaluation
                process are described below. Relevant forms and due dates are posted on Canvas. <u>All written
                deliverables should be submitted on Canvas</u>.
            </p>
            <div class="striped-border"></div>

            <p><strong>Attendance:</strong> I do not take attendance in class, and attendance, per se, is not part of your grade.
                However, note that there are assessments based on in-class activities that cannot be made up or turned
                in late. Also, keep in mind that <u>absence in class (except those with documented legitimate reasons) is not
                a reasonable explanation for missing the content, including announcement, which were covered that day.
                If you are absent, you are responsible for obtaining the information you missed</u>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Changes to Due Dates:</strong> I will do my best to stick to the scheduled due dates for assignments, exams, etc.
                Such dates are in Mountain Time, unless otherwise specified. I particularly try not to change the dates for
                exams so that you can plan your schedules accordingly. Any changes that are made will be announced in
                class and posted to Canvas. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are aware of any such changes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Technology Issues:</strong> It is your responsibility to make sure that your computer-based work is regularly
                saved and your online submission by deadline is successful. You should keep backup copies of your work
                (you are required to own media on which you backup your work). If technical problems make a duly
                submitted copy unreadable, you will be required to submit a backup with proper time stamp to have the
                work graded. Additionally, penalties in grading may also be taken depending on the nature of the
                problem. If you have no backup copy or your backup copy is unusable, you earn a grade of zero (0) for
                that assignment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Professionalism:</strong> I expect you to participate in class activities in a mature and appropriate manner.
                Behaviors that are disruptive or distracting to the class will not be tolerated. This policy is not meant to
                stifle honest and frank academic discussions; it is meant to foster a respectful and productive learning
                environment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Grade Discussion:</strong> Grades will be posted to the course Canvas site. It is the student's responsibility to
                check the Canvas web site to monitor his or her own grades. IMPORTANT: <u>Notification of intent to
                discuss any grade must be received in email within two weeks of the grade postings.</u> After two weeks, I
                will assume that you agree with our assessment and consider the grade final. To appeal, prepare a
                written statement detailing why you think the grade is unfair. Be sure to document your reasons. Stating
                simply that you feel you “deserve” a higher grade is not sufficient grounds for appeal. Submit the written
                statement along with the graded material (if appropriate). I will consider your complaint and make a
                decision. Re-evaluation will entail re-examining the entire report, assignment, or exam, and could result in
                score changes (i.e., increase or decrease) for each component of the assigned deliverable. You will be
                notified in writing of our decision. <u>Grade litigation must be done in person via an office appointment
                scheduled through email</u>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Documented Disability:</strong> Ensuring equal access to educational opportunities for all students is important
                to me. If you experience a disability or chronic illness (or even suspect that you do) and would like
                information about support services, please contact Resources for Disabled Students
                (http://www.rds.colostate.edu). If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class, please
                make an appointment to see me to discuss your individual needs. Any accommodation must be
                discussed in a timely manner prior to implementation. A verifying letter from Resources for Disabled
                Students may be required before any accommodation is provided.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I reserve the right to deviate from the schedule, and any changes to the schedule will be
                posted on Canvas and/or communicated by email. It is your responsibility to remain up-to-date. The
                scheduled dates for exams and other assessments are subject to change, but changes first will be
                discussed in class. Students are expected to attend classes and are responsible for obtaining information
                from missed classes from other students (including changes to due dates and assignments) and Canvas.
