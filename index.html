			<h2>Course Description & Objectives</h2>
			<p>There is considerable overlap between the Information Systems (IS), Computer Science, and Software
				Engineering disciplines. What makes IS unique is the emphasis on the development, implementation, and
				evolution of information technology (IT) systems and infrastructures to support organizational goals, such
				as reduced operating costs, improved productivity, innovation, and speed to market. The successful
				development and implementation of these systems and infrastructures depends, in large part, on the
				quality of analysis and design activities. CIS360 introduces the systems development life cycle and
				methodologies, with an emphasis on analysis and design activities, such as business process analysis,
				system requirements determination and specification, user interface design, and implementation
				alternative evaluation (e.g., custom in-house development, outsourcing, and cloud-based solutions). The
				overall goal of the course is for you to develop the knowledge and skills expected of an IT consultant,
				systems analyst, or business analyst. Systems analysis and design skills are also important for many
				other IT careers, such as information security analyst, project manager, software developer, user
				experience designer, web content manager, and data scientist</p>
